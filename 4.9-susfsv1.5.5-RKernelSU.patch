+ *
+ * Restrictions:
+ * The new_root and put_old must be directories, and  must not be on the
+ * same file  system as the current process root. The put_old  must  be
+ * underneath new_root,  i.e. adding a non-zero number of /.. to the string
+ * pointed to by put_old must yield the same directory as new_root. No other
+ * file system may be mounted on put_old. After all, new_root is a mountpoint.
+ *
+ * Also, the current root cannot be on the 'rootfs' (initial ramfs) filesystem.
+ * See Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt for alternatives
+ * in this situation.
+ *
+ * Notes:
+ *  - we don't move root/cwd if they are not at the root (reason: if something
+ *    cared enough to change them, it's probably wrong to force them elsewhere)
+ *  - it's okay to pick a root that isn't the root of a file system, e.g.
+ *    /nfs/my_root where /nfs is the mount point. It must be a mountpoint,
+ *    though, so you may need to say mount --bind /nfs/my_root /nfs/my_root
